Email seems to me like a good candidate for a government-provided electronic service. Even if management were contracted out to a private entity, providing emails to all residents of a geography (city/province/state/etc.) seems like a useful thing for government to do. You could use it as an official means of communication to residents, and provide a baseline for digital presence of your citizens. Email standards are now very mature and stable (enough so for every SME to be constantly iterating on their security abstractions). Why doesn't government provided email seem to exist anywhere? Universities do it. Why not government?<p>I can speculate about all kinds of reasons that this didn't happen, but I was too young to have watched the city council meetings where this might have been discussed. Does such a thing exist in China? Finland? Norway? The Netherlands?

    "description": "<p>Hey folks, grab a coffee or whatever you're into, because I'm about to spill the beans on this fun little adventure I had recently. Picture this: It's a lazy afternoon, I've just wrapped up some work stuff, and I'm mindlessly scrolling through YouTube like we all do. Suddenly, this video pops up from <strong>ThePrimeTime<\/strong> (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciNXbR5wvhU\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">check it out here<\/a>). It's all about website load times and this wild idea that your site should clock in under <strong>14KB<\/strong> to be truly snappy. I mean, come on \u2013 14KB? In 2025, with all these bloated JavaScript frameworks and fancy libraries we're slinging around? I was straight-up baffled. \"No way,\" I thought. \"That's gotta be impossible unless you're building a plain HTML page from the '90s.\"<\/p>\n\n<p>But curiosity got the better of me, as it always does. The video dives deep into the why behind it, referencing this super insightful blog post over at <a href=\"https://endtimes.dev/why-your-website-should-be-under-14kb-in-size/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">endtimes.dev<\/a>. If you haven't read it yet, do yourself a favor and click that link. It's packed with eye-opening stats and explanations on how even tiny delays in loading can tank user experience, especially on slower connections. Like, did you know that in some parts of the world, people are still rocking <strong>2G<\/strong> or spotty Wi-Fi? Yeah, that post really hammered home why size matters in web dev \u2013 not just for speed, but for accessibility and keeping folks from bouncing off your site in frustration.<\/p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  The Spark of Inspiration\n<\/h2>\n\n<p>Anyway, after watching that video, my brain was buzzing. I'd been putting off making a personal portfolio site for <em>ages<\/em>. Why? Pure laziness, my friends. I'm that dev who has a million ideas but somehow never gets around to personal projects. But this time, inspiration struck hard. \"Alright,\" I told myself, \"let's turn this into a challenge. Build something cool, keep it under 14KB, and make it actually useful \u2013 like a portfolio that shows off my skills without all the fluff.\"<\/p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Getting Started: Tools and Choices\n<\/h2>\n\n<p>So, where did I start? I went with the path of least resistance: <strong>Vite.js<\/strong>. If you're not familiar, Vite is this blazing-fast build tool that's perfect for modern web apps. It's simple to set up and handles a lot of the heavy lifting out of the box. But here's the catch \u2013 I initially thought about using <strong>React<\/strong> because, well, it's my go-to. Turns out, React's bundle size was way too chunky for my goals. No shade to React; it's awesome for complex stuff, but for a lightweight site? Nah.<\/p>\n\n<p>That's when I remembered <strong>Preact<\/strong>. I've tinkered with it before, and man, it's a gem. Preact is basically a super-slim alternative to React \u2013 it weighs in at just a few KB, has compatible APIs, so you can drop in your React knowledge without missing a beat. Perfect fit! I fired up a new project, swapped React for Preact, and started building.<\/p>\n\n<p>Now, to make things even more interesting (and challenging), I decided to throw <strong>Tailwind CSS<\/strong> into the mix. Yeah, I know \u2013 Tailwind can bloat things if you're not careful, but I wanted to prove I could keep it lean while styling an interactive site. The concept? A <strong>terminal-style portfolio<\/strong>. You know, like those old-school command-line interfaces, but web-ified. I vaguely remember seeing something similar years ago \u2013 maybe on some dev's GitHub or a tutorial? Can't find the link now, but it stuck in my head as this retro-cool way to present info. Imagine typing commands to navigate my about page, projects, or contact info. It's interactive, fun, and surprisingly engaging without needing heavy animations or libraries.<\/p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  The Optimization Magic\n<\/h2>\n\n<p>The real magic happened in optimization. I dove into the <code>vite.config.ts<\/code> file to tweak things for better chunking \u2013 basically splitting my vendors and code into smaller, smarter bundles. This way, the browser only loads what it needs. And after enabling <strong>Gzip compression<\/strong> (which most servers do anyway), each file ended up under <strong>13KB<\/strong>. Under 13KB! I was grinning like an idiot when I saw those numbers. It felt like winning a mini-hackathon against myself.<\/p>\n\n<p>Wanna see it in action? Head over to <a href=\"https://moonshadowrev.me\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">moonshadowrev.me<\/a>. Poke around, type some commands \u2013 it's all there. And if you're the code-curious type, the full repo is open on GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/moonshadowrev/moonshadow.me-portfolio\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">github.com/moonshadowrev/moonshadow.me-portfolio<\/a>. I even sprinkled in some basic SEO tricks, like meta tags and semantic HTML. It's not pro-level SEO wizardry, but hey, it's a start. Feel free to fork it, tweak it, or just browse for ideas.<\/p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Testing and Real-World Performance\n<\/h2>\n\n<p>Of course, I didn't stop at building \u2013 I had to test this bad boy. Fired up Google's <strong>PageSpeed Insights<\/strong>, and the scores were off the charts. Then, for the real torture test, I simulated a <strong>2G connection<\/strong> in dev tools. Holy smokes, it loaded almost instantly. I've built sites before that chug on slow networks, but this? It was like butter. And get this: I'm hosting it on shared <strong>Hostinger<\/strong> plans, which aren't exactly known for lightning TTFB (more on that in a sec). Even with static HTML, CSS, and JS files served from a budget host, it performs like a champ. Proves you don't need fancy CDNs or VPS to make things fast if you optimize from the ground up.<\/p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Breaking Down the Jargon: Server Response Time and TTFB\n<\/h2>\n\n<p>Speaking of TTFB and all that jargon, let's break it down real quick because it's key to understanding why this matters. <strong>Server response time<\/strong> is basically how long your server takes to chew on a request and start spitting back data. It's the behind-the-scenes hustle before anything shows up on the user's screen. <strong>TTFB<\/strong>, or <strong>Time to First Byte<\/strong>, is a bit broader \u2013 it measures from the moment the browser sends the request until it gets that very first byte of response. This includes stuff like DNS lookup (finding the server's address), establishing a secure connection (handshakes and all), and the initial server processing. Why care? Because a snappy TTFB makes your site <em>feel<\/em> responsive right away, even if the full load takes a second. High TTFB can kill conversions, SEO rankings, and user patience. In my tests, keeping everything lightweight shaved off precious milliseconds here, making the whole experience smoother.<\/p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Wrapping It Up\n<\/h2>\n\n<p>Looking back, this project was a blast \u2013 a reminder that sometimes, constraints breed creativity. It pushed me out of my lazy rut and taught me a ton about performance without overcomplicating things. If you're a dev reading this, give it a shot. Optimize that next project, chase those low KB goals, and see how it feels.<\/p>\n\n<p>What about you? Ever obsessed over TTFB or load times in your apps? Got tips, stories, or even critiques of my site? Drop 'em in the comments below \u2013 I'd love to chat and learn from ya. Let's keep the web fast and fun! 🚀<\/p>\n\n",

Parse and analyze:<\/strong> We first parse your source code into an AST, determine its dependencies, then generate a package.json file on-the-fly. Our analyzer allows you to pin versions of packages without the need for a lockfile or package.json.<br>\n<\/p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight js-code-highlight\">\n<pre class=\"highlight tsx\"><code><span class=\"k\">import<\/span> <span class=\"nx\">pkg<\/span> <span class=\"k\">from<\/span> <span class=\"dl\">'<\/span><span class=\"s1\">pkg@6.2.0<\/span><span class=\"dl\">'<\/span>\n<span class=\"k\">import<\/span> <span class=\"nx\">pkg<\/span> <span class=\"k\">from<\/span> <span class=\"dl\">'<\/span><span class=\"s1\">pkg@^6.2.0<\/span><span class=\"dl\">'<\/span>\n<span class=\"k\">import<\/span> <span class=\"nx\">pkg<\/span> <span class=\"k\">from<\/span> <span class=\"dl\">'<\/span><span class=\"s1\">pkg@~6.2.0<\/span><span class=\"dl\">'<\/span>\n<span class=\"k\">import<\/span> <span class=\"nx\">pkg<\/span> <span class=\"k\">from<\/span> <span class=\"dl\">'<\/span><span class=\"s1\">pkg@next<\/span><span class=\"dl\">'<\/span>\n<span class=\"k\">import<\/span> <span class=\"nx\">pkg<\/span> <span class=\"k\">from<\/span> <span class=\"dl\">'<\/span><span class=\"s1\">pkg<\/span><span class=\"dl\">'<\/span> <span class=\"c1\">// evaluates to @latest<\/span>\n<span class=\"kd\">const<\/span> <span class=\"nx\">pkg<\/span> <span class=\"o\">=<\/span> <span class=\"k\">await<\/span> <span class=\"k\">import<\/span><span class=\"p\">(<\/span><span class=\"dl\">\"<\/span><span class=\"s2\">pkg<\/span><span class=\"dl\">\"<\/span><span class=\"p\">)<\/span>\n<\/code><\/pre>\n\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Install dependencies<\/strong>: Dependencies are then installed at the beginning of each deploy using <code>bun install<\/code>. We tested every package manager under the sun and found Bun consistently outperformed the competition by <em>up to 10x<\/em>. With Bun, our entire deploy step takes less time to finish than <code>npm install fastify<\/code> did.<\/p>\n\n<div class=\"table-wrapper-paragraph\"><table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Package Manager<\/th>\n<th>Time to install <code>fastify<\/code>\n<\/th>\n<\/tr>\n<\/thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>npm/pnpm/yarn<\/td>\n<td><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><em>without lockfile generation<\/em><\/td>\n<td>&gt;6s<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>bun<\/td>\n<td>500ms<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table><\/div>\n\n<p><strong>3. Run your code:<\/strong> Bun allows you to execute TypeScript/JavaScript without transpiling first. Once we\u2019ve stripped the version strings from your imports, we can then run your code as is without a bundler and Bun will strip the types.<\/p>\n\n<h2>\n  \n  \n  Start deploying. Instantly.\n<\/h2>\n\n<p>Shortening the feedback loop to seconds isn't a marginal improvement \u2014 it fundamentally changes how you work. When you can deploy in 1 second, you're free to experiment, iterate, and ship while staying in flow.<\/p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fg9rmsrlsm6l3nmjdx2n6.png\" class=\"article-body-image-wrapper\"><img src=\"https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fg9rmsrlsm6l3nmjdx2n6.png\" alt=\"Railway functions example\" width=\"800\" height=\"308\"><\/a><br>\n<em>This is a real Function that took 00:01 seconds to deploy.<\/em><\/p>\n\n<p>Today Functions offers support out of the box for TypeScript, but in the future we'll be adding more language support.<\/p>\n\n<p>To get started, head over to Railway, open up the canvas, and add a new Function service.

Y estas imágenes puede que no se centren en eliminar algo de fondo, si no se pueden manipular imágenes para simular una situación que no es para nada real.<\/p>\n<!-- BREAK 1 -->\n<p>Esto es lo que ocurrió a un huésped que contrató el servicio de Airbnb y que afirmó tras su estancia que el anfitrión <strong>manipuló fotografías del piso para reclamarle diferentes daños que eran completamente falsos<\/strong>, pero que le habrían costado 12.000 libras (unos 9.000 euros).<\/p>\n<!-- BREAK 2 -->\n<p>Esta historia se remonta a principios de este año, cuando una mujer de Londres reservó un apartamento en Manhattan (Nueva York) durante dos meses y medio mientras estudiaba, <a rel=\"noopener, noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/aug/02/airbnb-guest-damage-claim-refund-photos\">tal y como relata<\/a> The Guardian. Pero debido a que no se sentía muy segura en el barrio, <strong>decidió dejar el apartament<\/strong>o antes de lo inicialmente acordado a través de Airbnb.<\/p>\n<!-- BREAK 3 -->\n<h2>Unas imágenes generadas con IA para simular daños falsos<\/h2>\n\n<p>Tras marcharse, no se esperaba que el anfitrión del apartamento informara a Airbnb que la mujer había causado daños valorados en miles de dólares en el apartamento. Entre estos daños incluía<strong> una mesa de café rota, un colchón manchado de orina <\/strong>y diferentes dispositivos como un televisor o microondas dañados.<\/p>\n<!-- BREAK 4 --><div class=\"article-asset-image article-asset-normal article-asset-center\">\n <div class=\"asset-content\">\n                   \n   <img alt=\"Cafe Grieta\" class=\"centro_sinmarco\" src=\"https://i.blogs.es/b8ba27/cafe-grieta/450_1000.webp\">\n   \n      <\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>La mujer negó la reclamación apuntando a que ella no había cometido esos daños y que durante las siete semanas que había estado en el apartamento solo habían pasado dos invitados. Incluso llegó a apuntar que esta reclamación de daños por parte del anfitrión, que era un 'superhost', en Airbnb era una venganza por haber terminado el contrato antes de tiempo.<\/p>\n<!-- BREAK 5 -->\n<p>Para poder argumentar estos daños, el anfitrión tuvo que subir una serie de imágenes. Pero tras analizarlas, la mujer vio que en las fotografías donde se mostraban los daños en la mesa de café la grieta en cada imagen era diferente. Esto la llevó a afirmar ante Airbnb que las imágenes estaban manipuladas.<\/p>\n<!-- BREAK 6 -->\n<p>En un primer momento, Airbnb decidió que la mujer debía pagar<strong> al anfitrión unos 7.000 dólares<\/strong>, pero lógicamente apeló porque ella no había cometido ningún daño. Cinco días después de que The Guardian preguntara a Airbnb sobre este caso, la compañía aceptó la apelación e ingresó en la cuenta de la afectada 663 dólares.<\/p>\n<!-- BREAK 7 -->\n<p>Pero debido a la mala experiencia que había tenido, la afectada apuntó a que no volvería a usar nunca más Airbnb (como haríamos cualquiera). Ante este caso, la compañía<strong> le ofreció a reembolsar una quinta parte del coste de la reserva,<\/strong> pero tras su negativa le reembolsaron el coste total de la estancia y también eliminaron la crítica negativa que dejó el anfitrión en su perfil.<\/p>\n<!-- BREAK 8 --><div class=\"article-asset article-asset-normal article-asset-center\">\n <div class=\"desvio-container\">\n  <div class=\"desvio\">\n   <div class=\"desvio-figure js-desvio-figure\">\n    <a href=\"https://www.genbeta.com/actualidad/booking-web-usada-para-buscar-alojamientos-hoteles-estan-hartos-espana-se-han-unido-para-demandarla\" class=\"pivot-outboundlink\" data-vars-post-title=\"Booking es la web favorita de los españoles para sus reservas... pero los hoteles están hartos de sus tratos.

Lo explica de la siguiente manera:<\/p>\n<!-- BREAK 9 -->\n<blockquote>Mi preocupación es por los futuros clientes que puedan ser víctimas de reclamaciones fraudulentas similares y no tengan los medios para oponerse tanto o cedan a pagar por miedo a una escalada. Dada la facilidad con la que ahora se pueden generar imágenes de este tipo con IA y, al parecer, ser aceptadas por Airbnb a pesar de las investigaciones, no debería ser tan fácil para un anfitrión salirse con la suya falsificando pruebas de esta manera<\/blockquote>\n\n<p>Desde Airbnb han informado que detallaron al anfitrión que no podía verificar las imágenes que se presentaron junto a la queja y que violaban los términos y condiciones del servicio. Esto hizo que le dieran un aviso, y que al siguiente informe similar se verían obligados a cerrar su cuenta. Además, también están llevando a cabo una investigación sobre como se manejó la situación con esta clienta y por qué al principio no la revisión no se percató del uso de IA en las imágenes.<\/p>\n<!-- BREAK 10 -->\n<p>Imágenes | <a rel=\"noopener, noreferrer\" href=\"https://unsplash.com/es/@veryinformed?utm_content=creditCopyText&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=unsplash\">Oberon Copeland<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>En Genbeta | <a class=\"text-outboundlink\" href=\"https://www.genbeta.com/a-fondo/airbnb-booking-me-han-quitado-que-me-gustaba-viajar-2000-gen-z-tiene-nostalgia-anos-yo-tambien\" data-vars-post-title=\"Airbnb y Booking me han quitado lo que más me gustaba de viajar en los 2000.

Esto es lo que ocurre con las famosas mirillas con cámara que permiten ver quien toca a la puerta o mantener vigilado un paquete que nos hayan dejado en el felpudo. Pero siempre ha generado dudas sobre qué ocurre si capta imágenes del resto de vecinos.<\/p>\n<!-- BREAK 1 -->\n<p>En el pasado son <a class=\"text-outboundlink\" href=\"https://www.genbeta.com/actualidad/instalar-mirilla-digital-le-costo-a-este-vecino-300-euros-aepd-no-para-cambiar-criterio\" data-vars-post-title=\"Instalar una mirilla digital le costó a este vecino 300 euros: la AEPD no para de cambiar de criterio \" data-vars-post-url=\"https://www.genbeta.com/actualidad/instalar-mirilla-digital-le-costo-a-este-vecino-300-euros-aepd-no-para-cambiar-criterio\">varias las resoluciones de la AEPD<\/a> que apuntaban a que estas cámaras no podían captar a los vecinos del rellano, pero ahora el Tribunal Supremo ha marcado un precedente con su última sentencia. Y es que en esta se confirma una condena <strong>contra una pareja que instaló una mirilla electrónica en su puerta,<\/strong> estableciendo el Supremo que la privacidad de los vecinos prevalece sobre la \"simple comodidad\" de saber si ha llegado un paquete.<\/p>\n<!-- BREAK 2 -->\n<h2><strong>Tener una mirilla digital les ha costado pagar 300 euros por vecinos afectado<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n<p>Este caso comenzó cuando una pareja decidió instalar una mirilla con cámara de seguridad en la puerta de su casa. En ese momento, los vecinos de enfrente de su rellano sintieron que su privacidad se veía vulnerada, ya que los vecinos <strong>iban a poder controlar sus movimientos <\/strong>y es por ello que les denunciaron. En este caso, el Juzgado de Primera Instancia dio la razón a los vecinos, y tras un recurso de los denunciados, el Supremo ha ratificado la sentencia.<\/p>\n<!-- BREAK 3 --><div class=\"article-asset-image article-asset-normal article-asset-center\">\n <div class=\"asset-content\">\n                   \n   <img alt=\"Mario Heller Dzookd3tbak Unsplash\" class=\"centro_sinmarco\" src=\"https://i.blogs.es/65ec09/mario-heller-dzookd3tbak-unsplash/450_1000.webp\">\n   \n      <\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p><strong>El problema no era la mirilla como tal, sino el uso y el alcance de su grabación. <\/strong>Tal y como marca la sentencia, <a rel=\"noopener, noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.abc.es/sociedad/supremo-rechaza-uso-mirillas-electronicas-problemas-seguridad-20250804112640-nt.html\">recogida por<\/a> ABC, el dispositivo en cuestión se activaba cada vez que alguien se aproximaba a la puerta de los vecinos, dada la corta distancia que había entre ambas viviendas en el rellano. Esto permitía a los propietarios no solo saber quién pasaba a la casa del vecino, sino incluso captar imágenes del interior de la vivienda vecina.<\/p>\n<!-- BREAK 4 -->\n<p>Una vez quedó probada esta invasión a la privacidad, el Supremo apunta a que <strong>no encontraron una necesidad real de seguridad<\/strong> que justificara la instalación de esta mirilla. La pareja argumentó que la instalación de la cámara se hizo por comodidad, ya que al pasar mucho tiempo fuera de casa querían estar atentos a si llegaba alguna notificación o paquete a su casa.<\/p>\n<!-- BREAK 5 -->\n<p>Sin embargo, el tribunal ha sido tajante ante este argumento. Lo primero es que no se habían reportado problemas de seguridad en toda la comunidad, llegando a apuntar que el edificio era un recinto cerrado y que contaba con conserjería. Por tanto, para los jueces esta medida no respondía a una amenaza real, sino a simple conveniencia de los vecinos. Incluso recalca que<strong> hay otras medidas de seguridad que no invaden la privacidad,<\/strong> como sensores de movimiento o servicios de alarma.<\/p>\n<!-- BREAK 6 --><div class=\"article-asset article-asset-normal article-asset-center\">\n <div class=\"desvio-container\">\n  <div class=\"desvio\">\n   <div class=\"desvio-figure js-desvio-figure\">\n    <a href=\"https://www.genbeta.com/actualidad/cada-vez-hay-flexibilidad-para-usar-movil-clase-aepd-advierte-puede-afectar-gravemente-a-alumnos\" class=\"pivot-outboundlink\" data-vars-post-title=\"Usar el móvil en los colegios e institutos es cada vez más frecuente: la AEPD advierte de los riesgos\">\n     <img alt=\"Usar&#x20;el&#x20;m&#x00F3;vil&#x20;en&#x20;los&#x20;colegios&#x20;e&#x20;institutos&#x20;es&#x20;cada&#x20;vez&#x20;m&#x00E1;s&#x20;frecuente&#x3A;&#x20;la&#x20;AEPD&#x20;advierte&#x20;de&#x20;los&#x20;riesgos\" width=\"375\" height=\"142\" src=\"https://i.blogs.es/18e832/chivalry-creative-kptpfnb2qpc-unsplash/375_142.webp\" onerror='this.src=\"https://i.blogs.es/18e832/chivalry-creative-kptpfnb2qpc-unsplash/375_142.jpeg\"'>\n    <\/a>\n   <\/div>\n   <div class=\"desvio-summary\">\n    <div class=\"desvio-taxonomy js-desvio-taxonomy\">\n     <a href=\"https://www.genbeta.com/actualidad/cada-vez-hay-flexibilidad-para-usar-movil-clase-aepd-advierte-puede-afectar-gravemente-a-alumnos\" class=\"desvio-taxonomy-anchor pivot-outboundlink\" data-vars-post-title=\"Usar el móvil en los colegios e institutos es cada vez más frecuente: la AEPD advierte de los riesgos\">En Genbeta<\/a>\n    <\/div>\n    <a href=\"https://www.genbeta.com/actualidad/cada-vez-hay-flexibilidad-para-usar-movil-clase-aepd-advierte-puede-afectar-gravemente-a-alumnos\" class=\"desvio-title js-desvio-title pivot-outboundlink\" data-vars-post-title=\"Usar el móvil en los colegios e institutos es cada vez más frecuente: la AEPD advierte de los riesgos\">Usar el móvil en los colegios e institutos es cada vez más frecuente: la AEPD advierte de los riesgos<\/a>\n   <\/div>\n  <\/div>\n <\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>De esta manera, como la grabación continua de los accesos a la vivienda vecino no estaba justificada por ningún tipo de interés de seguridad la sentencia es clara: tienen que retirar la mirilla electrónica y <strong>pagar una indemnización de 300 euros a cada uno de los vecinos afectados <\/strong>como indemnización por la intromisión ilegítima en su derecho a la intimidad.<\/p>\n<!-- BREAK 7 -->\n<p>Esta sentencia también es de gran relevancia porque el Tribunal Supremo crea jurisprudencia, que hace que ahora instalar este sistema de videovigilancia deba ser hecho con cuidado.

Y es que la dejadez a la hora de gestionar la bandeja de entrada del correo puede acarrear graves consecuencias, que pueden ser muy graves. Esto es lo que ha recogido la Audiencia Provincial de Valencia, que ha condenado a un administrador concursal a pagar de su bolsillo una <strong>indemnización de 15.000 euros por ignorar sistemáticamente los correos <\/strong>de una empresa acreedora durante un año.<\/p>\n<!-- BREAK 1 -->\n<p>Y es que en este caso la sentencia deja una clara tarea a cualquier persona que tiene un correo electrónico profesional: mirar el email no es una opción, sino que es una obligación inherente a la profesión.<\/p>\n<!-- BREAK 2 -->\n<h2>Ignorar el email sale muy caro<\/h2>\n\n<p>Esta historia se remonta a 2020, cuando una empresa constructora entró en concurso de acreedores. Se designó a un administrador concursal, que es una figura clave para gestionar las deudas que tienen las compañías y que tiene como función establecer un plan para afrontar los pagos de los acreedores.<\/p>\n<!-- BREAK 3 --><div class=\"article-asset-image article-asset-normal article-asset-center\">\n <div class=\"asset-content\">\n                   \n   <img alt=\"Solen Feyissa Iodnanpjl 4 Unsplash\" class=\"centro_sinmarco\" src=\"https://i.blogs.es/cd453c/solen-feyissa-iodnanpjl-4-unsplash/450_1000.webp\">\n   \n      <\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>Una de las empresas afectadas de este concurso, a la que se le adeudaban 14.202,88 euros correspondientes a facturas de 2019 y 2020, hizo lo que se esperaba: contactó con el administrador. Le envió las facturas y varios correos electrónicos solicitando información sobre el proceso y el estado de su deuda. La respuesta fue el silencio absoluto. Durante un año, cada email que se enviaba al administrador caía en un saco roto.<\/p>\n<!-- BREAK 4 -->\n<p>Para sorpresa de esta empresa, que quedó ignorada, el administrador cerró el proceso concursal y el plan de pagos sin incluir esta deuda que rondaba los 15.000 euros. Ante esta situación, lógicamente tuvieron que llegar hasta los tribunales, acusando al administrador de una negligencia a la hora de hacer su trabajo.<\/p>\n<!-- BREAK 5 -->\n<p><strong>El administrador no se veía como culpable. <\/strong>Pese a que le habían contactado, la parte reclamada apuntó a que la solicitud del pago de estas facturas pendientes no había llegado a tiempo, e incluso acusa a la empresa que debería haber insistido más al percatarse que su deuda no estaba en los informes. Básicamente, culpó al acreedor por no haber sido lo suficientemente persistente ante su propio silencio.<\/p>\n<!-- BREAK 6 -->\n<p>La justicia ha desmontado la defensa del administrador. La sentencia que ha hecho pública la Audiencia Provincial de Valencia ha sido bastante clara: la empresa notificó de forma correcta y a través de un canal válido como es el correo electrónico la solicitud de esta deuda. Pero en este caso, la responsabilidad de atender la comunicación era sin duda del administrador concursal.<\/p>\n<!-- BREAK 7 --><div class=\"article-asset article-asset-normal article-asset-center\">\n <div class=\"desvio-container\">\n  <div class=\"desvio\">\n   <div class=\"desvio-figure js-desvio-figure\">\n    <a href=\"https://www.genbeta.com/actualidad/usted-imbecil-aspirante-a-juez-insulto-email-a-funcionaria-ahora-supremo-le-ha-ensenado-puerta\" class=\"pivot-outboundlink\" data-vars-post-title=\"Un e-mail impide a un aspirante a juez obtener su plaza.
